# react-native-diff-view [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Monolist/react-native-diff-view.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Monolist/react-native-diff-view) ![David](https://img.shields.io/david/monolist/react-native-diff-view)

A React Native module for parsing and displaying git diffs. This library was heavily inspired by, and borrows code from, [react-diff-view](https://github.com/otakustay/react-diff-view).

## Overview

The purpose of this library is to parse and render a unified diff view for any provided diff(s). The flexible widget system also allows for rendering of custom elements on a per-line basis. The end result will look something like this:
